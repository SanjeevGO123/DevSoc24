# Weapon Detection System using YOLOv8

## Introduction
This project is a weapon detection system using YOLOv8. The system is designed to detect weapons in real-time using a webcam or a video file. The system is built using the YOLOv8 model and the PyTorch framework. The system is capable of detecting weapons in real-time with high accuracy. The system is designed to be used by law enforcement agencies and security personnel to detect weapons in public places and prevent crimes.
